A Plan for a New and Improved Testing Suite

Here is a concrete plan to refactor your testing suite into a modular, maintainable, and comprehensive set of tests. This plan is designed to be implemented with the help of a generative AI, focusing on structure and clear instructions over code snippets.

1. New Test Directory Structure

First, reorganize the tests directory to be more modular and reflect the structure of your plugin. This will make it easier to find and add tests for specific components.

tests/
├── conftest.py          # (Keep) Shared fixtures and configuration
├── unit/                # New directory for all unit tests
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── test_quench_plugin.py
│   ├── test_kernel_session.py
│   ├── test_web_server.py
│   └── test_ui_manager.py
├── integration/         # New directory for all integration tests
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── test_nvim_plugin.py
│   └── test_api_endpoints.py
└── e2e/                 # New directory for end-to-end tests
    ├── __init__.py
    ├── test_browser_integration.py
    └── fixtures/
        └── test_notebook.py

2. Unit Tests

The goal of the unit tests is to test each component in isolation. Use mocking extensively here to isolate the component under test.

    test_ui_manager.py:

        Move all existing NvimUIManager tests from tests/test_unit.py here.

        Add tests for edge cases, such as handling of different buffer states (e.g., empty buffer, buffer with no delimiters, etc.).

        Ensure all methods in ui_manager.py are covered.

    test_kernel_session.py:

        Move the KernelSessionManager tests from tests/test_unit.py here.

        Add comprehensive tests for KernelSession and KernelSessionManager.

        Test the lifecycle of a kernel session: start, execute, interrupt, restart, and shutdown.

        Test kernel discovery and error handling when jupyter_client is not available.

    test_web_server.py:

        Create unit tests for the WebServer class.

        Test WebSocket connection handling, message broadcasting, and API endpoints (/ and /api/sessions).

        Mock the KernelSessionManager to test the web server in isolation.

    test_quench_plugin.py:

        This will contain unit tests for the main Quench class from __init__.py.

        Move relevant tests from tests/test_quench_main.py here.

        Mock Neovim, KernelSessionManager, and WebServer to test the plugin's logic in isolation.

        Test each Quench... command's logic, focusing on how it interacts with the other components.

3. Integration Tests

Integration tests will test the interaction between different components of your plugin.

    test_nvim_plugin.py:

        This will test the interaction between the Quench plugin and a live Neovim instance.

        Use the pynvim library to start a headless Neovim instance and interact with it programmatically.

        Test that the commands correctly modify the Neovim state (e.g., QuenchRunCellAdvance moves the cursor).

        This is where you can test the synchronous parts of your commands that interact with Neovim's API.

    test_api_endpoints.py:

        Test the WebServer's API endpoints with live requests.

        Start the WebServer and use an HTTP client library (like aiohttp.test_utils) to make requests to / and /api/sessions.

        Test the WebSocket connection and message passing with a real WebSocket client.

4. End-to-End (E2E) Tests

This is the most complex part but also the most valuable. E2E tests will simulate a user's entire workflow.

    test_browser_integration.py:

        Use a browser automation framework like Playwright or Selenium to control a headless browser.

        The test would:

            Start a headless Neovim instance with the plugin loaded.

            Programmatically open a Python file (from e2e/fixtures).

            Execute a cell using a pynvim command.

            Start a headless browser and navigate to the web server's URL.

            Assert that the output (e.g., a plot or HTML) is correctly rendered in the browser.

        This will be the best way to test your frontend JavaScript and its interaction with the backend.

5. conftest.py and Fixtures

    Keep conftest.py for shared fixtures.

    Create fixtures for:

        A headless Neovim instance.

        A temporary Python file with test cells.

        A running WebServer instance for integration and E2E tests.
